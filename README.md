## Getting started

1. [Installation with docker](https://github.com/arelate/vangogh/wiki/Installation-with-docker) is the recommended way to get started with `vangogh`.
2. After you've installed `vangogh` service, [Authorization and user management](https://github.com/arelate/vangogh/wiki/Authorization-and-user-management) can help you add and manage users.
3. Then, [Server administration](https://github.com/arelate/vangogh/wiki/Server-administration) will help you authenticate with GOG.com and keep your data updated.

## vangogh and GOG.com games sharing guidelines

`vangogh` assumes you follow GOG.com [games sharing guidelines](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/212184489-Can-I-share-games-with-others-?product=gog). Just like GOG.com, we trust you that this will not be abused.
